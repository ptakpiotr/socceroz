## General info
This is my first more complex React Native app however I don't consider it a fully fledged solution. This app was more of a playground for new things I learned in the process like zod or react-query. In order to run it you will have to set 2 env variables (both are API keys).
## Technologies
- React Native (Expo)
- React Query
- Zod
